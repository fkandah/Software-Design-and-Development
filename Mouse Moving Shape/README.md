# MouseMovingShape

  

#####In this code we are implementing some mouse actions such that when the user will be able to drag the shape using the mouse:
 - We start by checking whether the mouse position is inside the shape when the user presses the left mouse button. 
 - Then we will initiate the dragging process so that when the user drags the mouse, the shape will follow the mouse.       

### In the code:
- CarShape: To create a car shape
- StarShape: To create a start shape
